# Reddit-2-Gener-8-a-Video-IV

### Inspiration
I was slightly irked by how little effort could be done to [churn out videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=askreddit) that don't introduce anything new to YouTube yet gander hundred of thousands of views.  I wanted to push that churnability to the limit.  **Why not do it at the [*SB Hacks VI*](http://sbhacks.com/) hackathon?**

### What it does
As of *2020-01-12 03:56 UTC*, the only completed feature is generating the screenshots from input post data *(this is no longer true)*.

### How I built it
I started out with implementing a system that generates a Reddit-styled screen-capture based on parameters (i.e. upvotes, subreddit styling, username).  I also worked on tethering the text-to-speech service to my codebase, which was **significantly** easier.

### Challenges I ran into
To begin with, the biggest challenge I faced by far was learning to write the scripts in Scheme and Script-Fu.  It's function syntax is weird and the excess of round brackets is ugly.  Likewise, I misunderstood the whereabouts of the team formation event and ended up not getting to partner up with anyone.

### Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I learnt a new language (Scheme for Gimp)!

### What I learned
I learnt that large tech companies will give out hundreds of dollars worth of useful Cloud-based stuff that I could take advantage of in the future.  I also learnt a new language.

### What's next for Reddit2Gener8aVideo4
As I'm placing the submittal the night before, there is more I could work on before the expo deadline.  I also intend to begin the stage of integrating FFMPEG into the codebase and possibly have a working prototype by the morning.
